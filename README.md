# Web-Map-Application
## Abstract
This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and informative interactive map showcasing COVID-19 data from recent years. The map incorporates two key visualization techniques: chloropleth maps to represent COVID-19 rates, and proportional symbols to highlight the distribution of cases.

## Implementation
### 1. Map Initialization

- Utilizing the Mapbox JavaScript library, initialize an interactive map with a focus on the target region.
- Apply an aesthetically pleasing style, such as 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v10', to enhance readability.

### 2. Chloropleth Visualization

- Create a chloropleth layer on the map, associating colors with COVID-19 rates.
- Implement a color scale to represent varying rates, ensuring a clear visual distinction between regions.

### 3. Proportional Symbols

- Add a layer of proportional symbols to visualize COVID-19 cases.
- Use circle sizes to proportionally represent case numbers, allowing users to quickly identify areas with higher case counts.

### 4. Interactivity
- Implement event listeners to enable interactivity, such as hovering over regions for detailed information or clicking for further insights.
- Include a legend to guide users in interpreting the visualizations

### 5. Responsive Design
- Employ responsive CSS techniques to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.
